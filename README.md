# GFVIEM_multilayer
This code contains functions that have overloaded with numba, meaning it talks together with the "scipy.integrate.quad" routine.
This makes for faster evaluation of common Sommerfelt integrals needed for calculation of dyadic Green's functions for multilayered reference structures,  as found in e.g T. M. SÃ¸ndergaard: Green's function integral equation method in Nano-optics
